# Minecraft Deployments

With Strela, you can deploy Minecraft servers to Kubernetes using the MinecraftDeployment resource. This resource is a custom resource definition (CRD) that allows you to define a Minecraft server and deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.  {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Getting started with proxies

We're getting started with proxies, as they are used in most Minecraft server setups. If you want to deploy a Minecraft server, you can use the same steps, but you will need to use a different image and port. You can find a better example in the [Getting started with servers](#) section.

```yaml {{ title: 'Example MinecraftDeployment' }}
apiVersion: strela.dev/v1
kind: MinecraftDeployment
metadata:
  labels:
    # We define this label to be able to create a service, so the Minecraft server can be accessed from the server list
    app: example-proxy-deployment
  name: example-proxy-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  type: PROXY
  template:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            # We use our Docker image for a Minecraft proxy server.
            # You can use any other image, but make sure it's starting a Minecraft server.
            - image: ghcr.io/strela-dev/docker-minecraft-proxy:main
              imagePullPolicy: Always
              name: server
              tty: true
              stdin: true
              ports:
                # This might be different for your image, but it's usually 25577 for Minecraft proxies
                - containerPort: 25577
                  name: main
              env:
                # Our image is based on itzg/bungeecord, so we use a variable to start a velocity server
                # If you use a different image, you might need to use a different variable
                - name: "TYPE"
                  value: "VELOCITY"
```

Please keep in mind that we don't register any servers on the proxy by default. If you want that every server you deploy is automatically registered on the proxy, you have to use our additional [Proxy Plugin](#) for Velocity or BungeeCord.

## Getting started with servers

If you want to deploy a Minecraft server, you can use the same steps, but you will need to use a different image and port. Here's an example of how you can deploy a Minecraft server:

```yaml {{ title: 'Example MinecraftDeployment' }}
apiVersion: strela.dev/v1
kind: MinecraftDeployment
metadata:
  labels:
    # We define this label to be able to create a service, so the Minecraft server can be accessed from the server list
    app: example-server-deployment
  name: example-server-deployment
spec:
    replicas: 1
    type: SERVER
    template:
        spec:
        template:
            spec:
            containers:
            # We use our Docker image for a Minecraft server.
            # You can use any other image, but make sure it's starting a Minecraft server.
            - image: ghcr.io/strela-dev/docker-minecraft-server:main
              imagePullPolicy: Always
              name: server
              tty: true
              stdin: true
              ports:
                # This might be different for your image, but it's usually 25565 for Minecraft servers
                - containerPort: 25565
                  name: main
              env:
                # Our image is based on itzg/bungeecord, so we use a variable to start a velocity server
                # If you use a different image, you might need to use a different variable
                - name: "EULA"
                  value: "TRUE"
```

If you want to be redirected to any server, you can use our additional [Proxy Plugin](#) for Velocity or BungeeCord. Just keep in mind that you have to put it in the proxy's plugins folder and not in the server's plugins folder.

## Using an SDK

If you want to use an API to deploy Minecraft server, you can use on of our official SDKs. They offer a simple way to interact with the Strela API and create and manage MinecraftDeployments.
