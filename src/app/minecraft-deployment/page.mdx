# Minecraft Deployments

With Strela, you can deploy Minecraft servers to Kubernetes using the MinecraftDeployment resource. This resource is a custom resource definition (CRD) that allows you to define a Minecraft server and deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.
A MinecraftDeployment orchestrates the creation and management of Minecraft servers. It achieves this by generating MinecraftServerSets, which in turn, instantiate the actual MinecraftServer resources. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Get started with proxies

We're getting started with proxies, as they are used in most Minecraft server setups. If you want to deploy a Minecraft server, you can use the same steps, but you will need to use a different image and port. You can find a better example in the [Get started with servers](#get-started-with-servers) section.

The first thing you need to do is to create a MinecraftDeployment resource. In this case we're using a Docker image that is based on [itzg/bungeecord](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/bungeecord). You can read their documentation, if you want to use a different configuration.

For this example we'll name the file `example-proxy-deployment.yaml` and we'll use the following content:

```yaml {{ title: 'example-proxy-deployment.yaml' }}
apiVersion: strela.dev/v1
kind: MinecraftDeployment
metadata:
  labels:
    # We define this label to be able to create a service, so the Minecraft server can be accessed from the server list.
    app: example-proxy-deployment
  name: example-proxy-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  type: PROXY
  template:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            # We use our Docker image for a Minecraft proxy server.
            # You can use any other image, but make sure it's starting a Minecraft server.
            - image: ghcr.io/strela-dev/docker-minecraft-proxy:main
              imagePullPolicy: Always
              name: server
              tty: true
              stdin: true
              ports:
                # This might be different for your image, but it's usually 25577 for Minecraft proxies.
                - containerPort: 25577
                  name: main
              env:
                # Our image is based on itzg/bungeecord, so we use a variable to start a velocity server.
                # If you use a different image, you might need to use a different variable.
                - name: "TYPE"
                  value: "VELOCITY"
```

After you've created the file, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f example-proxy-deployment.yaml
```

Please keep in mind that we don't register any servers on the proxy by default. If you want that every server you deploy is automatically registered on the proxy, you have to use our additional [Server Registration Plugin](/plugin/server-registration) for Velocity or BungeeCord.

## Configure load balancing for proxies
// TODO: Add a guide on how to configure load balancing for proxies.

## Get started with servers

To create a Minecraft server, you can use the following example. If your server has state, that you want to keep between restarts, or your server needs to be identified by a number (e.g. for a lobby server), you should use a MinecraftStatefulSet instead of a MinecraftDeployment. You can find more information about the MinecraftStatefulSet in the [MinecraftStatefulSet documentation](/docs/minecraft-stateful-set).

For this example, we're using a Docker image that is based on [itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server). You can read their documentation, if you want to use a different configuration.

In our case we'll name the file `example-server-deployment.yaml` and we'll use the following content:

```yaml {{ title: 'example-server-deployment.yaml' }}
apiVersion: strela.dev/v1
kind: MinecraftDeployment
metadata:
  labels:
    name: example-server-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  type: SERVER
  template:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            # We use our Docker image for a Minecraft server.
            # You can use any other image, but make sure it's starting a Minecraft server.
            - image: ghcr.io/strela-dev/docker-minecraft-server:main
              imagePullPolicy: Always
              name: server
              tty: true
              stdin: true
              ports:
                # This might be different for your image, but it's usually 25565 for Minecraft servers.
                - containerPort: 25565
                  name: main
              env:
                # Our image is based on itzg/bungeecord, so we use a variable to start a velocity server.
                # If you use a different image, you might need to use a different variable.
                - name: "EULA"
                  value: "TRUE"
```

After you've created the file, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f example-server-deployment.yaml
```

If you want to be redirected to any server, when you join a proxy, you can use our additional [Server Connection Plugin](/plugin/server-connection) for Velocity or BungeeCord. Just keep in mind that you have to put it in the proxy's plugins folder and not in the server's plugins folder.

## Set up private Docker images

You can use private Docker images for your Minecraft servers. To do so, you have to create a secret in your Kubernetes cluster and use it in your MinecraftDeployment.

To create a secret, you can use the following command:


<CodeGroup>
    ```bash {{ title: 'Github Container Registry' }}
    kubectl create secret docker-registry custom-registry-secret \
      --docker-server=ghcr.io \
      --docker-username=GITHUB_USER \
      --docker-password=GITHUB_PASSWORD \
      --docker-email=GITHUB_EMAIL
    ```

    ```bash {{ title: 'Docker Hub' }}
    kubectl create secret docker-registry custom-registry-secret \
      --docker-server=index.docker.io \
      --docker-username=DOCKER_USER \
      --docker-password=DOCKER_PASSWORD \
      --docker-email=DOCKER_EMAIL
    ```

    ```bash {{ title: 'Other' }}
    kubectl create secret docker-registry custom-registry-secret \
      --docker-server=DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER \
      --docker-username=DOCKER_USER \
      --docker-password=DOCKER_PASSWORD \
      --docker-email=DOCKER_EMAIL
    ```
</CodeGroup>

After you've created the secret, you can use it in your MinecraftDeployment. You can use the following example to do so:

<CodeGroup>

    ```yaml {{ title: 'example-proxy-deployment.yaml' }}
    apiVersion: strela.dev/v1
    kind: MinecraftDeployment
    metadata:
      labels:
        # We define this label to be able to create a service, so the Minecraft server can be accessed from the server list.
        app: example-proxy-deployment
      name: example-proxy-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      type: PROXY
      template:
        spec:
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
                # We use our Docker image for a Minecraft proxy server.
                # You can use any other image, but make sure it's starting a Minecraft server.
                - image: ghcr.io/strela-dev/docker-minecraft-proxy:main
                  imagePullPolicy: Always
                  name: server
                  tty: true
                  stdin: true
                  ports:
                    # This might be different for your image, but it's usually 25577 for Minecraft proxies.
                    - containerPort: 25577
                      name: main
                  env:
                    # Our image is based on itzg/bungeecord, so we use a variable to start a velocity server.
                    # If you use a different image, you might need to use a different variable.
                    - name: "TYPE"
                      value: "VELOCITY"
                  imagePullSecrets:
                    - name: custom-registry-secret
    ```


    ```yaml {{ title: 'example-server-deployment.yaml' }}
    apiVersion: strela.dev/v1
    kind: MinecraftDeployment
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: example-server-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      type: SERVER
      template:
        spec:
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
                # We use our Docker image for a Minecraft server.
                # You can use any other image, but make sure it's starting a Minecraft server.
                - image: ghcr.io/strela-dev/docker-minecraft-server:main
                  imagePullPolicy: Always
                  name: server
                  tty: true
                  stdin: true
                  ports:
                    # This might be different for your image, but it's usually 25565 for Minecraft servers.
                    - containerPort: 25565
                      name: main
                  env:
                    # Our image is based on itzg/bungeecord, so we use a variable to start a velocity server.
                    # If you use a different image, you might need to use a different variable.
                    - name: "EULA"
                      value: "TRUE"
                  imagePullSecrets:
                    - name: custom-registry-secret
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Interact with a started MinecraftServer

If you want to interact with a started MinecraftServer, you have to find the pod name of the server. You can do so by using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

After you've found the pod name, you can use the following command to attach with the server:

```bash
kubectl attach -it POD_NAME
```

Now you can run any command you want to run on the server. For example, you can kick a player by using the following command:

```bash
kick Fllip
```

## Spec Fields

The `MinecraftDeploymentSpec` defines the desired state of your Minecraft server deployment. Below are the properties you can specify in the MinecraftDeployment spec:

<Properties>
    <Property name="replicas" type="integer">
        Specifies the number of replicas for the Minecraft server deployment. Default is 1 if not specified.
    </Property>

    <Property name="type" type="MinecraftDeploymentType">
        Defines the type of Minecraft server. Can be one of "PROXY" or "SERVER".
    </Property>

    <Property name="template" type="MinecraftServerTemplateSpec">
        A template for creating the [MinecraftServerSet](/minecraft-server-set) instances. Includes also the configuration for the [MinecraftServer](/minecraft-server) resource.
    </Property>
</Properties>

## Status Fields

The `MinecraftDeploymentStatus` reflects the observed state of the MinecraftDeployment. It provides runtime information about the servers:

<Properties>
    <Property name="replicas" type="integer">
        The current number of replicas of the server that are managed by this MinecraftDeployment.
    </Property>

    <Property name="ready" type="integer">
        The number of replicas that are in a Ready state. Ready replicas are those that have successfully started and are available for players.
    </Property>
</Properties>

## Types

`MinecraftDeploymentType` is an enumeration that specifies the server type. It supports the following values:

- `PROXY`: A proxy server for connecting multiple servers.
- `SERVER`: A standard Minecraft server for gameplay.

---

Ensure you apply the correct YAML configuration based on this specification to manage your Minecraft servers effectively within your Kubernetes cluster.

## Using an SDK

If you want to use an API to deploy Minecraft server, you can use on of our official SDKs. They offer a simple way to interact with the Strela API and create and manage MinecraftDeployments.
