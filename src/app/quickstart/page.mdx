# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use Strela in your Kubernetes cluster. We'll cover how to get started using Helm. We'll also look at how you can install Kubernetes before you're getting started with Strela. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you install Strela, it would make sense to first understand how Kubernetes and Strela work in general. You can find this under [Crash Course](/crash-course).
</Note>

## Choose your Kubernetes distribution

Before start with Strela you need to choose your Kubernetes distribution. In the following example, you can see how to install a few Kubernetes distributions on Linux.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'k3s' }}
# k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

```bash {{ title: 'microk8s'}}
# microk8s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution

# 1. Install MicroK8s on Linux
sudo snap install microk8s --classic

# 2. Check the status while Kubernetes starts
microk8s status --wait-ready

# 3. Turn on the services you want
microk8s enable dashboard
microk8s enable dns
microk8s enable registry
microk8s enable istio
microk8s enable helm
```


</CodeGroup>

Please keep in mind that these are just examples, and you can find many more distributions on the internet.

## Get started with Helm

After picking your preferred distribution, you are ready to install our Helm chart. Below, you can see how to install the Strela Helm chart.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'Helm'}}
# Add the Strela Helm repository
helm repo add strela https://helm.strela.dev

# Install the Strela Helm chart
helm install strela strela/strela --namespace strela-system --create-namespace
```
