# Minecraft Stateful Sets

MinecraftStatefulSets are a way to manage a number of [Minecraft Servers](/minecraft-server). Unlike a [MinecraftDeployment](/minecraft-deployment), a MinecraftStatefulSet is designed to manage stateful applications, such as lobby servers. This means that each server in the set has a unique identity. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
    If you want to create Minecraft servers without state or identity (for example games like BedWars), you should use a [MinecraftDeployment](/minecraft-deployment) instead.

## Get started with Minecraft Stateful Sets

We are currently working on MinecraftStatefulSets, and they are not yet available. If you want to be notified when they are available, you can join our <a href="https://discord.strela.dev" target="_blank">Discord server</a>.

## Spec Fields

As we're still working on MinecraftStatefulSets, the spec fields are not available yet, but they will probably be similar to the ones in [MinecraftDeployment](/minecraft-deployment).

## Status Fields

As we're still working on MinecraftStatefulSets, the status fields are not available yet, but they will probably be similar to the ones in [MinecraftDeployment](/minecraft-deployment).

## Using an SDK

If you want to use an API to deploy Minecraft server, you can use on of our official SDKs. They offer a simple way to interact with the Strela API and create and manage MinecraftServers.
