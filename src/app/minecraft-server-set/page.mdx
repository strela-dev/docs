# Minecraft Servers

A MinecraftServerSet is based on a [Kubernetes ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/), which is a controller that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. It is a part of the [MinecraftDeployment](/minecraft-deployment) resource, which is used to create multiple Minecraft servers.
The MinecraftServerSet is used to create a single [Minecraft Server](/minecraft-server), which is responsible for the actual Minecraft server instance. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
    Not that you don't need to create a MinecraftServerSet yourself. It's automatically created when you create a [MinecraftDeployment](/minecraft-deployment).
</Note>

## Getting started with Minecraft Server Sets

To get started with MinecraftServerSets, you need to create a [MinecraftDeployment](/minecraft-deployment) resource. This will automatically create a MinecraftServerSet for you.

This means that you don't need to create a MinecraftServerSet yourself. It's automatically created when you create a [MinecraftDeployment](/minecraft-deployment). It is also not recommended to modify the MinecraftServerSet directly, as it is managed by the [MinecraftDeployment](/minecraft-deployment) and may cause issues if modified.


## Spec Fields

The `MinecraftServerSetSpec` outlines the desired configuration of a set of Minecraft servers. The following properties are configurable:

<Properties>
    <Property name="replicas" type="integer">
        The desired number of server instances in the set. This allows for the scaling of Minecraft servers to accommodate varying loads and player counts.
    </Property>

    <Property name="template" type="MinecraftServerTemplateSpec">
        A template describing the common configuration for all servers in the set. This includes server version, settings, mods, and other configurations.
    </Property>
</Properties>

## Status Fields

The `MinecraftServerSetStatus` reflects the observed state of the MinecraftServerSet, providing insights into the operational status of the servers:

<Properties>
    <Property name="replicas" type="integer">
        The current number of replicas in the server set. This may differ from the desired count during scaling operations or if there are issues with starting some server instances.
    </Property>

    <Property name="ingame" type="integer">
        The number of servers that are currently being used. This helps in understanding how many servers are actively being used.
    </Property>

    <Property name="ready" type="integer">
        The number of servers that are ready to accept players. Servers may not be ready immediately upon startup due to initialization processes.
    </Property>
</Properties>

## Using an SDK

If you want to use an API to deploy Minecraft server, you can use on of our official SDKs. They offer a simple way to interact with the Strela API and create and manage MinecraftServers.
